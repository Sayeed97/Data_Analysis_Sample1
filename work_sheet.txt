You are the manager for a chain of cinemas. You are asked to review the data for 3 cinemas for the past 3 months.

Company: Light Speed

Data: Total number of ticket sales | Number of sales | Revenue for the concession stand (Soda, Popcorn, and Candy).

Goal: Comparing the revenue of the concession stand between the three cinemas highlighting which of the three cinemas has the most successful concession stand, and how it compares to others.

TO DO: Find which is the best performing concession stand. Understand which of the concession stand is the most successful.

Some assumptions:

1. What is a successful concession stand? The one that sold the most product
2. How does selling the most product in a concession stand fit into business objectives? One of the main revenues sources for the cinema is concession stands so maximize on the concession sales for each ticket sold.
3. Objective of this data presentation? Identify which cinema was the best, and what factors made it the best (it could be concession stand sales due to pricing or just the sales number or tickets sold).

Question: Which of the three Cinemas do you suspect is performing the best?

Answer: The one that brings in maximum revenue per ticket sold.

Question: What does a successful concession stand look like?

Answer: The one that sold the most products in concession stand.

Question: How does selling the most product fit into the business’s objectives? Could you provide some background?

Answer: We don’t have any say on what movies get made, and how they’re advertised and how an audience will review them – we can only sell tickets to whatever movie is out. Whenever we sell a ticket, a large portion of it goes to the movie studio, then from what is left, once you consider the cost of running the cinema, profit margins on ticket sales are slim. So the main revenue we generate is from the concession stand. Our objective is to maximise revenue at the concession stand for each ticket sold.

Question: Is there any specific questions I should investigate within the data?

Answer: Cinema 2 Generated the most Revenue per ticket sold (per customer).

Question: So what would a good presentation look like to you?

Answer: Cinema 2 has the least tickets sold over the three months and still did exceptional well with its concession stand sales.
